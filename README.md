# Table-View-Controller
This a Objective C program which will gide you to create a table in your xcode.
First in your storyboard place a table view not view controller !
Then take a cell and add to it.
Then link all delegates to the table and create a custome cell.
Adding a custom cell class in your project.
Then link all cell and table with labels or whatever you are going to take to display something.
